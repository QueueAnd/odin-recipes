        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This classic salad is a celebration of rich, cooling flavors and a diversity of textures.<p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>     
            <li>2 small tomatoes (about 8 ounces total), diced</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 small red onion, minced</li>
            <li>White wine vinegar, for soaking onion (see notes)</li>
            <li>4 ounces bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>2 ounces (about 1/2 cup) fresh bread crumbs</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 head iceberg lettuce, outer leaves discarded, quartered through core so that each quarter holds together</li>
            <li>Buttermilk blue cheese dressing (you may not need the full recipe)</li>
            <li>Minced chives, for garnish</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Set a fine-mesh strainer over a bowl and add diced tomatoes. Sprinkle liberally with salt and toss to combine. Place onion in a small bowl and pour enough vinegar on top to cover. Let tomatoes and onion stand while you prep the other ingredients.</li>
            <li>In a small skillet, cook bacon over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until crisped, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a paper towel–lined plate to drain. You should have about 2 tablespoons (30ml) rendered fat in the skillet. Add bread crumbs and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until browned and crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel–lined plate to drain and season liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>A slotted spoon stirs small, browned pieces of bacon on a skillet. </li>
            <li>Arrange iceberg wedges on plates and spoon dressing over each. Drain quick-pickled onions and sprinkle all over salads, along with drained tomatoes (discard any extracted liquid), bacon, toasted bread crumbs, and chives. Serve.</li>
        </ol>
